# Recruitment Task - Shoe Store Page

## About the Project

This project is a fully responsive landing page for an e-commerce shoe store, created as a recruitment task. It showcases the use of modern front-end technologies like **HTML5**, **LESS**, and **JavaScript (jQuery)** to build a dynamic and visually appealing user interface.

The project is built upon the **Bootstrap 5** framework to ensure a solid, responsive grid and ready-to-use components. It also utilizes the **Slick Carousel** library for implementing interactive sliders. The combination of these tools allowed for the rapid development of a functional and aesthetically pleasing design.

## 💭 Conclusions from the Project

Using the **LESS** preprocessor allowed for cleaner, modular, and more manageable stylesheets, significantly improving the scalability and maintainability of the CSS code. **JavaScript**, combined with the **jQuery** library, made it easy to add interactivity, handle dynamic content switching in tabs, and manage the mobile menu, which positively impacted the user experience (UX). Leveraging ready-made solutions like **Bootstrap** and **Slick Slider** greatly accelerated the development of the visual and interactive layers of the project.
